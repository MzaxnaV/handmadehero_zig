# Handmade Hero zig

Handmade Hero personal repo written in zig (0.14). I try to be close to what Casey does, with small changes where it makes sense to me.

For debug profiler display set `PROFILE` option to `true` in build.zig.
Custom tools on [code/tools](/code/tools).

In addition to handmade hero stuff you'll find [references](/misc/RESOURCES.md) and other things in the [misc folder](/misc/README.md).
